# DigitWatchVic20
When you have a VIC-20 in the office… what can you do to show everyone what it’s capable of?
Simple: a digital clock that keeps you company and lets everyone see what time it is!

This program has the simple purpose of displaying a 7-segment clock on the screen of a stock VIC-20. Nothing special—just a way to put the computer to use in the office.

Let me know if you liked the program. Feel free to email me if you need any information.

In the code you’ll find the following commands:
{reverse on} → enables reverse characters
{cm j} → means you must press the Commodore key together with the J key to display the character on screen.

{cm } indicates the use of the Commodore key, which must be pressed together with the key that follows.
